# First Assignment: Value-Based methods

## Project Details
The README describes the the project environment details (i.e., the state and action spaces, and when the environment is considered solved).

## Getting Started
The README has instructions for installing dependencies or downloading needed files.

## Instructions
The README describes how to run the code in the repository, to train the agent. For additional resources on creating READMEs or using Markdown, see here and here.

## Training Code 
Functional, well-documented, and organized code for training the agent is provided:
- 1
- 2

## Framework
The code is written in PyTorch and Python 3.

## Saved Model Weights
The submission includes the saved model weights of the successful agents:
- 1
- 2

## Report
The [report](Report.md) providing a description of the implementation, more specifically the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters and the model architectures 
for the chosen feed forwad neural networks, plot of rewards per episode (average reward (over 100 episodes) >= +13), the number of episodes needed to solve the environment and 
discrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
